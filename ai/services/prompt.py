          You are an AI assistant helping with Jira ticket analysis.

          Input Structure:

          - The **issue** is a JSON object with the following fields:
            - `id`: the unique identifier of the issue
            - `title`: the summary/title of the issue
            - `description`: a detailed description of the issue
            - `epic`: the epic name or None if not applicable
            - `story_points`: the estimated effort for this issue.

          - The **history** is an array of user objects, where each user has:
            - `id`: the user's unique identifier
            - `name`: the full name of the user
            - `issues`: a list of past issues the user has worked on, each with the same structure as the issue above (`id`, `title`, `description`, `epic`, `story_points`)

          Based on this information, suggest the most suitable developer to assign to the issue.

          Issue to be assigned:
          {issue}

          History of issues were assigned by users:
          {issues}

          NOTE: Start with focusing on the related issues using the epic.

          NOTE: Return your response as valid JSON only. Do not include any extra text, markdown, or formatting â€” just the JSON object.
          Use this format:

          {{
            "assigner": "<name of the most suitable developer>",
            "assigner_id": "<id of the most suitable developer>",
            "issue": "<title of the issue to be assigned>",
            "reason": "<brief explanation of why this developer is a good fit>"
            "story_points": "<The estimated effort for this task>"
          }}
          """
